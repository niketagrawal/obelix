get_neighbour_distance
======================

.. py:module:: get_neighbour_distance

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This script was used on the Cartesius cluster to extract bond distances for given atoms, this functionality was
   also incorporated as a function in utitilities.py

.. py:data:: ob_log_handler

.. py:function:: get_neighbour_bond_distance(source_mol_file, atom_index, search_this_atomic_num)

   Use Openbabel's meethods to find the distance of a specific atom to a given atom, the atoms should be bonded
   and the atom should be searched by using it's atomic number
   if you don't know the index of the central atom use get_neighbour_distance_search.py

   :param source_mol_file:
   :param atom_index:
   :param search_this_atomic_num:
   :return: list of distance between indicated central atom and atoms that are bonded to it with given atomic number
