get_neighbour_distance_search
=============================

.. py:module:: get_neighbour_distance_search

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This script uses openbabel dependency. It was used on the Cartesius cluster to extract bond distances for given atoms. This functionality is
   also incorporated as a function in utilities.py

.. py:data:: ob_log_handler

.. py:function:: get_neighbour_bond_distance_search(source_mol_file, central_atom_atomic_num, search_this_atomic_num)

   Use Openbabel's meethods to find the distance of a specific atom type to a given atom type, the atoms should be
   bonded and the specific atom type that is searched for should be searched by using it's atomic number.
   This function is useful if the given atom does not have a known index in the molecule,
   if you know the index of the central atom use get_neighbour_distance.py
